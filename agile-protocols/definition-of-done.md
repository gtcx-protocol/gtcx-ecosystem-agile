## 🔍 **DoD Validation Process**

### **Development Team Validation**
1. **Developer Self-Check**: Developer validates against DoD checklist
2. **Peer Code Review**: Peer developer reviews code and validates DoD
3. **QA Testing**: QA team validates testing requirements
4. **Security Review**: Security team validates security requirements
5. **Final Validation**: Team lead validates overall DoD compliance

### **Stakeholder Validation**
1. **Product Owner Review**: Validates business requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Business User Testing**: Business users validate functionality and usability
3. **Stakeholder Approval**: Final stakeholder sign-off and approval

## 📊 **DoD Quality Metrics**

### **DoD Compliance Tracking**
- **Stories Meeting DoD**: [X] / [Total Stories]
- **DoD Compliance Rate**: [X]%
- **Common DoD Gaps**: [List of frequent missing criteria]
- **Quality Improvements**: [Actions to improve DoD compliance]

### **Quality Indicators**
- **Code Quality**: Code review completion rate, technical debt levels
- **Testing Coverage**: Test coverage percentages, test pass rates
- **Security Posture**: Security scan results, vulnerability counts
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, error rates

- **External Dependencies**: External factors prevent DoD completion

### **Escalation Process**
1. **Identify DoD Gap**: Document which DoD criteria cannot be met
2. **Assess Impact**: Evaluate impact of not meeting DoD criteria
3. **Escalate to Product Owner**: For business requirement issues
4. **Escalate to Technical Lead**: For technical feasibility issues
5. **Create Mitigation Plan**: Plan to address DoD gaps
6. **Risk Assessment**: Assess risks of proceeding without full DoD
