Repository workflow
- PR-only: never push to main; use feature branches and small, scoped PRs.
- Show scope first: list files to change and a short diff preview; wait for explicit approval.
- Size limits: ≤20 files and ≤500 changed lines per PR unless approved by the user.
- Keep user on main: do not switch the user’s working branch without approval.
- Read-only by default: only edit paths the user whitelists for the current task.
- No CI/bots: do not enable CI/CD, bots, or change repo settings without approval.
