Path whitelist
- Documentation tasks: default allowed path is only `**/agile-pm/**` unless the user expands scope.
- Protocols code: only inside the named project folder (e.g., `gtcx-ecosystem-protocols/geotag/**`) after approval.
- Platforms code: only inside the named platform folder (e.g., `gtcx-ecosystem-platforms/crx/**`) after approval.
- Any other path requires explicit approval in this thread before editing.
