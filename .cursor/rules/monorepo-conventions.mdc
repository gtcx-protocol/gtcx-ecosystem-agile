Monorepo conventions
- Root hygiene: Only README.md and package.json at the monorepo root unless explicitly approved; all code/docs live in sub‑repos.
- _archive/ is read‑only historical content. Never write into or reorganize it.
- Backups: The backup at /Users/amanianai/Sites/backups/gtcx-protocol-ecosystem copy/ is the authoritative source for recovery; use it read‑only.
