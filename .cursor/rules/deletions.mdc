Deletions policy
- Default: no deletions, moves, or renames.
- Any deletion requires explicit chat approval: “APPROVED: delete <exact paths>”.
- Paths must be itemized (no globs).
- If >10 paths: repeat the exact list and require “CONFIRM: delete <same list>”.
- Prefer non‑destructive `archive/` moves over hard delete; hard delete only with explicit approval.
- Only consider deletions in user‑whitelisted paths for the current task.
- Never delete or rewrite git history.
- If missing approval or scope isn’t explicit, do nothing (fail closed).
