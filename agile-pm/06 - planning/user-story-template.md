## **üåü Best Practices**

### **Writing Good User Stories**
- **Focus on user value** - What does the user get out of this?
- **Keep it simple** - One story, one piece of functionality
- **Make it testable** - Clear acceptance criteria
- **Consider edge cases** - What could go wrong?
- **Think mobile-first** - How does this work on mobile?

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- ‚ùå **Too technical** - Focus on user needs, not implementation
- ‚ùå **Too vague** - Be specific about what success looks like
- ‚ùå **Too large** - Break down into smaller, manageable stories
- ‚ùå **Missing value** - Every story should provide clear user benefit
