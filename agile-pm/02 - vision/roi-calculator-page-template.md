# 💰 ROI Calculator Page Template - [PROJECT_NAME]

## Purpose
Help stakeholders estimate ROI and impact of adopting [PROJECT_NAME] based on jurisdiction inputs.

## Inputs
- Total units (e.g., parcels)
- Currently registered (%)
- Average value per unit ($)

## Calculation Model (pseudocode)
```
unregistered = total * (1 - registeredPct)
newRegs5y = unregistered * adoptionRate
currentRevenue = total * registeredPct * value * tax
newRevenue = newRegs5y * value * tax
revenueIncrease = newRevenue
savings = disputes * reductionRate * disputeCost
benefit5y = (revenueIncrease * 5) + (savings * 5)
roi = (benefit5y - implementationCost) / implementationCost
payback = implementationCost / (revenueIncrease / 12)
```
