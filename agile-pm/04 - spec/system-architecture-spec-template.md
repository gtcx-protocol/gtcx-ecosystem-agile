### 2.2 Threat Model
| Threat Category | Specific Threat | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| [Category] | [Threat] | [Mitigation] | [Risk] |

### 2.3 AuthN/AuthZ
- Authentication Methods: [methods]
- Authorization Model: [RBAC/ABAC]

---

## 4. Data Model Specifications
Define core entities with DDL or models, constraints, indexes, and integrity rules.

---

## 5. Network/Protocol Specifications
- Inter-service protocol stack: [serialization, transport, security]
- Message formats (schemas/proto)
- Consensus/coordination protocols (if any)

---

## 6. Performance Requirements
- Latency targets (P50/P95/P99) per operation
- Throughput targets (TPS) per component
- Scalability targets (records, users, regions)

---

## 7. Compliance Matrix
