### 2.2 Threat Model
| Threat Category | Specific Threat | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| [Category] | [Threat] | [Mitigation] | [Risk] |

### 2.3 AuthN/AuthZ

---

## 4. Data Model Specifications
Define core entities with DDL or models, constraints, indexes, and integrity rules.

---

## 5. Network/Protocol Specifications
