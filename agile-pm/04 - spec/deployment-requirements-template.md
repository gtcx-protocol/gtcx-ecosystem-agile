## 1. Infrastructure Requirements

### 1.1 Minimum Hardware/Cloud Specs
Provide on-prem and cloud instance sizes by tier (application, database, cache, load balancer).

### 1.2 Network Requirements
- Bandwidth & latency targets
- Segmentation & VPN requirements
- Network security (WAF, DDoS, IPS/IDS)

### 1.3 Software Dependencies
- OS versions, kernels, required modules
- Runtime & platform versions (DB, cache, runtime)

---

## 2. Reference Architectures
Provide diagrams and descriptions for target architectures (cloud-native, hybrid, on-prem), including segmentation and DR links.

---

## 3. Deployment Procedures

### 3.1 Pre-Deployment Checklist
Create infra/security validation checklists (hardware, network, certificates, backups, monitoring).

### 3.2 Deployment Sequence
Provide phased, scriptable steps for infra, platform, and application rollout, with verification commands.

---

## 4. Operational Runbooks
- Key rotation procedures
- Database failover (auto/manual)
- Incident runbooks for critical services

---

## 5. Capacity Planning
- Baselines and thresholds for scale-up
- Growth projections model (storage, vCPU, memory)

---

## 6. Disaster Recovery
- RTO/RPO targets per component
- Backup schedules and retention
- Full site recovery procedure & validation

---

## 7. Monitoring & Observability
- Metrics (collection, retention), dashboards
- Logs (aggregation, retention), tracing (sampling)
- Alert catalog (critical/major/minor)

---
