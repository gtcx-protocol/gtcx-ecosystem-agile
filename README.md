## Executive summary ✨
GTCX is sovereign verification infrastructure for global trade. Five core protocols — TradePass, GeoTag, GCI, VaultMark, and PvP — turn real‑world statements and documents into independently verifiable proofs that CRX, SGX, and AGX use to automate permits, listings, and settlement. The result is moving from weeks of paperwork and opaque intermediaries to same‑day approvals and sub‑second settlement.

### Core components at a glance
- TradePass — Identity & authorization: verifies people/orgs; issues time‑boxed roles/entitlements.
- GeoTag — Provenance evidence: cryptographic location/timestamping and device attestation.
- GCI — Compliance & policy: machine‑evaluated eligibility and attestations.
- VaultMark — Custody & audit: sealed, tamper‑evident chain‑of‑custody and ownership checks.
- PvP — Settlement: atomic both‑or‑neither payment‑versus‑physical exchange.
- PANX — Verification service: composes protocol artifacts into thresholded proofs for CRX/SGX/PvP.
- Cortex — Analytics & anomalies: ingests proofs/events, summarizes signals, flags anomalies.
- ANISA — Cultural intelligence: guidance that improves capture and interactions in the field.

### By the numbers
| Signal | Value |
| :-- | :-- |
| Global commodity trade | ~$13T annually |
| Value lost to frictions | ~30% (≈$3.9T) |
| Identity verification | 3 weeks → ~30 seconds |
| Compliance eligibility | 3 weeks → ~2 minutes |
| Permit issuance (CRX) | typical ≤ 6 hours |
| Settlement (PvP) | atomic < 1 second; 10M+ daily tx scale |

Outcomes (targets):
- Identity: 3 weeks → ~30 seconds (TradePass)
- Origin proof: “impossible” → instant (GeoTag)
- Compliance eligibility: 3 weeks → ~2 minutes (GCI)
- Permit issuance: typical ≤ 6 hours (CRX)
- Custody: continuous, sealed audit across transfers (VaultMark)
- Settlement: atomic PvP < 1 second; scales to 10M+ daily transactions

### System at a glance
- TradePass: identity verification 3 weeks → ~30 seconds; capacity ~1M entities/day
- GeoTag: origin proof from “impossible” → instant (cryptographic GPS signatures + device attestation)
- GCI: compliance evaluation 3 weeks → ~2 minutes (policy engine + attestations)
- VaultMark: continuous digital chain of custody; instant ownership verification; sealed audit
- PvP: atomic payment‑versus‑physical; settlement < 1s; scales to 10M+ daily transactions

## Who this is for
- Governments and regulators seeking sovereignty‑preserving digital infrastructure (e.g., permits in ≤ 6 hours; +40% revenue capture seen in models)
- Verified producers and cooperatives needing market access with trust guarantees (direct access; better pricing)
- Exchanges, vaults, and banks integrating proof‑based, atomic settlement
- Integrators and open‑source builders adopting a protocol‑first stack

## What is needed for trade (and why)
Buyers, regulators, and exchanges ask the same questions. Each answer must be verifiable.

- **Who am I buying from?** TradePass proves the identity of people and organizations and grants time‑boxed roles (e.g., exporter) so authorization is portable and auditable.
- **Where is the product sourced from?** GeoTag produces cryptographic location and timestamped evidence for production and transit events; VaultMark binds that evidence to sealed custody.
- **Is it responsibly sourced and compliant?** GCI evaluates eligibility against jurisdictional policies using attached evidence; CRX turns the result into a permit with an audit trail.
- **Do the goods I receive match what was listed?** VaultMark maintains an unbroken digital chain‑of‑custody and instant ownership checks; PANX provides proof thresholds per event type.
- **Will payment and delivery happen together?** PvP performs atomic “both‑or‑neither” settlement using VaultMark custody references and PANX proof links, eliminating exposure.

## Three‑tier architecture (overview) 🏗️
1) Protocols — specifications and data contracts (research repo)
2) Intelligence systems — PANX, Cortex, ANISA (this org)
3) Platforms and apps — Exchanges and Field‑First Mobile Applications

#### Protocols layer
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  TP["TradePass"] --> GT["GeoTag"]
  GT --> VM["VaultMark"]
  VM --> PVP["PvP"]
  GCI["GCI"] --> TP
  GCI --> PVP
```
Protocols are composable, not strictly linear. TradePass authorizes capture, GeoTag produces signed evidence, VaultMark seals artifacts, and PvP gates settlement. GCI applies policies into both authorization and settlement.

#### Intelligence systems layer 🧠
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  ANISA["ANISA Cultural"] <--> PANX["PANX Verification"]
  PANX -->|verified events / metrics| CORTEX["Cortex Analytics"]
  CORTEX -.->|anomaly alerts / re‑verify triggers| PANX
  CORTEX -.->|insights / topics| ANISA
```
Intelligence systems enrich, verify, and analyze protocol artifacts. ANISA adds cultural context; PANX turns evidence + policy into network proofs; Cortex aggregates and visualizes signals for operators.

#### Platforms layer 🏛️
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  CRX["CRX Regulatory"]
  SGX["SGX Sovereign Exchange"]
  AGX["AGX Global Exchange"]

  CRX --> SGX
  SGX --> CRX
  SGX --> AGX
  AGX --> SGX
  CRX -.-> AGX
  AGX -.-> CRX
```
Platforms interoperate rather than strictly chain. CRX feeds sovereign approval/compliance into SGX; SGX returns market and custody events back to CRX. AGX connects multiple SGX instances to international buyers; limited CRX↔AGX links exist for export controls and revenue reporting.

## Actors and the problems we solve
| Actor | Pain today | What GTCX provides | Outcomes (targets) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Producers & cooperatives | Identity/origin not trusted; 6‑month permits; predatory middlemen; no price discovery | TradePass, GeoTag, GCI → CRX same‑day eligibility; SGX listing; VaultMark custody; PvP settlement | Onboard ≤1 day; eligibility ~2 min; better pricing; fraud reduction |
| Exporters & aggregators | Paper chains; disputed lots; delays at ports | VaultMark sealed custody; PANX proofs; CRX/SGX routing | Instant ownership verification; fewer holds; faster throughput |
| Regulators & ministries (CRX) | Fragmented systems; leakage; long queues | CRX workflow + policy engine; GCI attestations; audit trail | Permits ≤ 6 hours; +revenue capture; transparent audits |
| Vaults, warehouses, logistics | Mixed inventory risk; manual logs; dispute exposure | VaultMark digital twins; GeoTag arrival/departure proofs | No mixing; verifiable chain; insurance/risk down |
| Buyers & traders (SGX/AGX) | Opaque provenance; counterparty risk; slow settlement | Proof‑backed listings; PvP atomic settlement | Trusted supply; <1s settlement at execution |
| Banks/PSPs & settlement rails | Reconciliation risk; chargebacks; manual compliance | PvP orchestration; proof references; policy gating | Both‑or‑neither finality; automated compliance |
| Auditors & civil society | ESG unverifiable; after‑the‑fact investigations | Sealed artifacts (VaultMark), location proofs, policy history | Real‑time verification; credible oversight |

### Regulator (CRX operator)
- Intake arrives with TradePass identity and GCI eligibility attached
- CRX routes to departments; SLA timers start automatically
- Evidence links deep‑link to GeoTag artifacts and VaultMark seals
- Approver signs digitally; permit is issued with audit hash
- Dashboard shows queue, throughput, revenue capture, and anomalies
- Typical path: eligibility received ~2 min; permit turnaround same‑day (≤ 6h)

## Problems we solve
Trade today fails in predictable ways. The GTCX stack addresses each failure with a concrete, verifiable mechanism.

- **Identity without portability**: Registries, paper IDs, and manual KYC do not travel across agencies or borders. Every jurisdiction restarts the process, creating weeks‑long queues and inconsistent permissions. TradePass issues cryptographically verifiable identities and time‑boxed roles so authorization is portable, least‑privilege, and auditable.

- **Provenance without proof**: Documents move faster than goods. By the time a lot reaches the port, origin can be disputed, lots can be mixed, and there is no independent way to verify claims. GeoTag anchors events to cryptographic location and time, while VaultMark binds those events to sealed digital custody so provenance can be checked instantly, without calling the source.

- **Policy without consistency**: Rules are clear on paper but applied differently in practice. Interpretations diverge across desks and regions, creating bottlenecks, leakage, and unpredictable outcomes. GCI evaluates eligibility the same way every time against explicit policies, and CRX turns those decisions into transparent workflows with measurable SLAs.

- **Settlement without finality**: Payment and delivery occur on separate rails, leaving counterparties exposed and disputes to escalate. PvP settles “both‑or‑neither” atomically, using VaultMark custody references and PANX proof links so execution is instant, correct, and independently auditable.

### Market reality
| Metric | Current State | Impact |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Annual commodity trade | ~$13T | Massive addressable scope |
| Value lost to frictions | ~30% (≈$3.9T) | Efficiency upside |
| Permit processing | ~6 months | Deals die waiting |
| Origin verification | ~0% | ESG impossible |
| Digital infrastructure | Paper/PDF | 2025 still manual |

### Structural failures
| Structural failure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Identity without trust | Weeks to verify; rampant fraud |
| Location without proof | Origin mixing; unverifiable chain |
| Compliance without speed | Rules change; processes don’t |
| Settlement without certainty | Intermediaries; failed trades |

## Protocols (foundation)
Core protocol specifications live in `gtcx-ecosystem-research/02-protocol-specifications/`.

| Protocol | Purpose | Key elements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| TradePass | Identity & authorization | DIDs/VCs; roles; entitlements |
| GCI | Compliance & policy | credentials; attestations; scoring |
| GeoTag | Evidence | cryptographic location; timestamping; device attestation |
| VaultMark | Audit | sealed receipts; custody chain |
| PvP | Settlement | post‑verification; atomic payment‑versus‑physical |

Transport and data contracts use JSON Schema with versioned `$id`.

### The five protocols (deep dives)
- TradePass (Identity & Authorization): DIDs/VCs, role catalogs, time‑boxed grants, least‑privilege; composes with GCI and PANX weights
- GCI (Compliance & Policy): attestations, algorithmic scoring, jurisdictional policies, predictive risk; gates roles and settlement
- GeoTag (Evidence): multi‑constellation GPS, satellite correlation, HSM signatures, Merkle proofs; replaces claims with proofs
- VaultMark (Audit): physical‑digital binding (NFC/RFID), digital twins, immutable custody; prevents verification washing
- PvP (Settlement): atomic payment‑versus‑physical; settlement only when proof+policy pass

#### Protocol outcomes
| Layer | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TradePass | 3 weeks manual checks | ~30 seconds verification |
| GeoTag | Origin unverifiable | Instant cryptographic location proof |
| GCI | Weeks to evaluate | ~2 minutes eligibility |
| VaultMark | Custody breaks; disputes | Continuous sealed audit; instant ownership check |
| PvP | 3–5 day wires; exposure | Atomic settlement < 1s; both‑or‑neither finality |

## Use cases (flagship)
- Permit issuance (regulator): GCI decides eligibility the same way every time; CRX issues with an audit trail; VaultMark references seal artifacts. Time drops from months to hours.
- Depart/arrive verification (logistics): GeoTag evidence + VaultMark custody → PANX proof; Cortex raises real‑time alerts for anomalies.
- Corridor policy enforcement (government): GCI applies explicit rules; TradePass gates roles; decisions are consistent and explainable.
- Milestone‑based payment (banks): PANX proof drives PvP release; VaultMark custody prevents mixing; settlement is atomic.
- Dispute packet (operators): VaultMark + GeoTag + GCI produce a complete, sealed bundle others can independently verify.

## Pilot plan (one week)
Day 1 — Site onboarding
- Issue TradePass; pair GeoTag; enable VaultMark seals; create first lot.

Day 2 — Capture and verify
- Record depart/arrive with signed evidence; PANX thresholds per event type.

Day 3 — Govern and simulate
- GCI policy gates; simulate corridor rules; tune thresholds with dissent capture.

Day 4 — Dry‑run settlement
- PvP release conditions on proof references; bank/rail integration dry‑run.

Day 5 — Report and review
- Sealed audit bundle; metrics in Cortex; operator retro.

Telegram TradeBox
- Chat‑first onboarding (multi‑language, low bandwidth) for producers and clerks; see the TradeBox journey below.

## Q&A
- Is PANX a protocol?
  - No. PANX is a verification service that consumes protocol artifacts to produce network proofs.
- What’s sealed?
  - Proofs, custody events, and artifacts via VaultMark.
- How do I run a pilot quickly?
  - Start with GeoTag + VaultMark at one site; add GCI/TradePass; then PANX; gate PvP last.

## Glossary
- Protocol — shared rulebook and data contracts
- Proof — evidence‑backed claim you can independently verify
- Seal — tamper‑evident record preserved for audit
- Atomic settlement — payment/delivery only complete together
- Eligibility — outcome of GCI policy evaluation
- Custody — chain of ownership and control recorded by VaultMark
- Threshold — role‑weighted rule in PANX required to reach proof “achieved”

## Three‑tier architecture 🏗️

Protocols are composable, not strictly linear. TradePass authorizes capture, GeoTag produces signed evidence, VaultMark seals artifacts, and PvP gates settlement. GCI applies policies into both authorization and settlement.

#### Intelligence systems layer

```
Intelligence systems enrich, verify, and analyze protocol artifacts. ANISA adds cultural context; PANX turns evidence + policy into network proofs; Cortex aggregates and visualizes signals for operators.

##### Product narratives (who it’s for, what it solves, how it feels)
- **ANISA — Cultural Intelligence (field‑first)**
  A cooperative lead opens the VIA app to register a new site. Before any photo or coordinate is taken, ANISA whispers the local terms that build trust, the questions to ask, and the proof to capture (“include the co‑op board stamp; take a wide shot of the entrance; avoid market‑day crowding at noon”). During capture it flags risks (“vendor IDs don’t match roster”) and suggests phrasing that de‑escalates (“ask for the lot book, not the receipt”). The guidance is saved alongside the artifacts so when TradePass and GeoTag submit to CRX, the evidence reads correctly the first time—less back‑and‑forth, fewer rejections.
  In short: ANISA improves the human layer so the technical layer (TradePass, GeoTag, VaultMark) lands cleanly.

- **PANX — Verification (not a protocol)**
  - Who: CRX permit approvers, SGX listing desks, banks settling PvP.
  - Problem: evidence exists but trust is subjective and slow; stakeholders need a neutral, repeatable verdict.
  - Story: given a lot and its artifacts (TradePass roles, GeoTag evidence, VaultMark custody, GCI eligibility), PANX returns a proof: `{ achieved, percentage, hints[], dissent[] }`. CRX reads the proof to gate permits; SGX uses it to list; PvP references it to settle.
  - Maps to: “Permit issuance”, “Milestone‑based payment”, “Depart/arrive verification”, “Pilot — Verify”.
  - Note: PANX is a service that consumes protocol artifacts to produce network proofs.

- **Cortex — Analytics & Anomalies (operations room)**
  - Who: regulators’ ops centers, exchange supervisors, logistics leads.
  - Problem: signals are scattered; trends and outliers are invisible until too late.
  - Story: Cortex ingests PANX proofs and custody/market telemetry, produces summaries, and flags anomalies (e.g., unusual dwell time). It can trigger PANX re‑verify and feeds operator dashboards.
  - Maps to: “Depart/arrive verification” (real‑time alerts), “Dispute packet” (complete trail), “Pilot — Report”.

#### Now → Next → Later (concise)
- Now: protocol hardening; schema compatibility CI; reference SDKs.
- Next: federation, multi‑rail settlement, secure attestation, smart seals, persistence/retention, observability.
- Later: PANX/Cortex agentic behaviors; corridor pilots; onboarding funnels.
- Protocol hardening & specification snapshots
  - TradePass, GCI, GeoTag, VaultMark, PvP: stabilize core semantics and data contracts
  - Snapshot cadence and change control (proposal → review → RFC → snapshot)
  - Conformance test suite and fixtures per protocol (positive/negative cases)
- Schema‑first development
  - Semantic versioning rules, deprecation windows, and upgrade playbooks
  - Reference client SDKs for TypeScript/Python (schema‑bound types, validators)
  - CI gates for schema compatibility and sample instance coverage
- Interoperability & federation (from protocols repo roadmap)
  - TradePass federation and identity linking across jurisdictions
  - PvP multi‑rail connectors (banking, mobile money, crypto) with atomicity proofs
  - GeoTag secure attestation (device certs, HSM rotation, field audit trail)
  - VaultMark smart seal program and digital twin APIs
- Persistence & retention
  - Managed Postgres/Timescale for proofs/events, partitioning and TTL policies
  - Audit archive export (cold storage bundles signed by VaultMark)
- Observability
  - Service metrics and SLOs; dashboards for operators and regulators
  - Distributed tracing with selective sampling; alert runbooks
- Agentic behaviors (progressive)
  - PANX: borderline re‑verify plans; dynamic thresholds informed by risk/quality
  - Cortex: anomaly watchers, action proposals, operator copilot integrations
- Pilots & reference implementations
  - Corridor deployments with partners; playbooks for CRX/SGX/AGX rollout
  - Telegram onboarding funnels linked to TradePass/GeoTag quickstarts

## Telegram onboarding (fast path)

### TradeBox: chat‑first onboarding that meets users where they are
TradeBox is our Telegram experience that gets producers, exporters, and officials live in hours—not weeks. It turns identity, provenance, and permits into a guided conversation that runs on any phone, in low bandwidth, in local languages.

- Bot and utilities: [Telegram bot README](gtcx-ecosystem-shared/utilities/gtcx-utility-telegrambot/README.md) · [TradeDesk README](gtcx-ecosystem-shared/utilities/gtcx-utility-tradedesk/README.md)
- Strategy (narrative): [Telegram bot strategy](gtcx-ecosystem-specs/telegram/telegram-bot-strategy.md) · Commands and flows: [Bot commands](gtcx-ecosystem-specs/telegram/gtcx-bot-commands-readme.md)

### User journey (TradeBox)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User as "User"
  participant BOT as "GTCX TradeBox (Telegram)"
  participant TP as "TradePass"
  participant GT as "GeoTag"
  participant GCI as "GCI"
  participant CRX as "CRX (Permits)"
  participant SGX as "SGX"
  participant AGX as "AGX"

  User->>BOT: /start · choose language and role
  BOT->>User: Explain value, privacy, next steps
  User->>BOT: Submit ID photos (guided)
  BOT->>TP: Verify ID and issue credentials
  Note over TP: ~30s typical

  BOT->>User: Pair GeoTag device / capture location evidence
  User->>BOT: Share location & batch context
  BOT->>GT: Verify cryptographic location & timestamp
  Note over GT: instant

  BOT->>GCI: Eligibility Q&A with attached evidence
  GCI-->>BOT: Eligibility result and requirements
  BOT->>CRX: Pre‑registration + artifacts
  CRX-->>User: Permit status link (when eligible)

  BOT-->>SGX: Create listing shell (when permitted)
  SGX-->>AGX: Federated discovery
```

What you walk away with
- TradePass identity and roles you can show anywhere (QR or code)
- GeoTag setup and a first signed location proof
- Eligibility status and a CRX application in flight
- If permitted: a listing shell in SGX discoverable via AGX

Operator view (why it works at scale)
- Languages, voice, and offline queuing reduce friction dramatically
- Structured captures push clean artifacts into TradePass/GeoTag/VaultMark
- PANX/Cortex hooks let ops monitor completion, anomalies, and progress
