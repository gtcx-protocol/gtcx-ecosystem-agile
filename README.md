## Executive summary
GTCX is sovereign verification infrastructure for global trade. Five core protocols — TradePass, GeoTag, GCI, VaultMark, and PvP — convert claims into machine‑verifiable proofs that CRX, SGX, and AGX use to automate permits, listings, and settlement. The result is moving from weeks of paperwork and opaque intermediaries to same‑day approvals and sub‑second settlement.

Outcomes (targets from the technical advisors primer):
- Identity: 3 weeks → ~30 seconds (TradePass)
- Origin proof: “impossible” → instant (GeoTag)
- Compliance eligibility: 3 weeks → ~2 minutes (GCI)
- Permit issuance: typical ≤ 6 hours (CRX)
- Custody: continuous, sealed audit across transfers (VaultMark)
- Settlement: atomic PvP < 1 second; scales to 10M+ daily transactions

### System at a glance (from technical advisors primer)
- TradePass: identity verification 3 weeks → ~30 seconds; capacity ~1M entities/day
- GeoTag: origin proof from “impossible” → instant (cryptographic GPS signatures + device attestation)
- GCI: compliance evaluation 3 weeks → ~2 minutes (policy engine + attestations)
- VaultMark: continuous digital chain of custody; instant ownership verification; sealed audit
- PvP: atomic payment‑versus‑physical; settlement < 1s; scales to 10M+ daily transactions

## Who this is for
- Governments and regulators seeking sovereignty‑preserving digital infrastructure
- Verified producers and cooperatives needing market access with trust guarantees
- Exchanges, vaults, and banks integrating proof‑based settlement
- Integrators and open‑source builders adopting a protocol‑first stack

## Problems we solve
- Fragmented identity and inconsistent policy enforcement across jurisdictions
- Location/provenance fraud and unverifiable documentation
- Trust bottlenecks that slow approvals, trading, and settlement
- Audit gaps and verification “washing” through custody chains

## Protocols (foundation)
Core protocol specifications live in `gtcx-ecosystem-research/02-protocol-specifications/`.
- TradePass — identity & authorization (DIDs/VCs, roles, entitlements)
- GCI — compliance & policy (credentials, attestations, scoring)
- GeoTag — evidence (cryptographic location, timestamping, device attestation)
- VaultMark — audit (sealed receipts, custody chain)
- PvP — settlement (post‑verification, atomic payment‑versus‑physical)

Transport and data contracts use JSON Schema with versioned `$id`.

### The five protocols (deep dives)
- TradePass (Identity & Authorization): DIDs/VCs, role catalogs, time‑boxed grants, least‑privilege; composes with GCI and PANX weights
- GCI (Compliance & Policy): attestations, algorithmic scoring, jurisdictional policies, predictive risk; gates roles and settlement
- GeoTag (Evidence): multi‑constellation GPS, satellite correlation, HSM signatures, Merkle proofs; replaces claims with proofs
- VaultMark (Audit): physical‑digital binding (NFC/RFID), digital twins, immutable custody; prevents verification washing
- PvP (Settlement): atomic payment‑versus‑physical; settlement only when proof+policy pass

## Five flagship use cases
- Permit issuance: GCI + TradePass + VaultMark; hours instead of weeks
- Depart/arrive verification: GeoTag + VaultMark → PANX proof; real‑time alerts
- Corridor policy enforcement: GCI + TradePass; transparent, consistent governance
- Milestone‑based payment: PANX proof → PvP + VaultMark; risk‑free release
- Dispute packet: VaultMark + GeoTag + GCI; complete sealed evidence

## Pilot in one week (checklist)
1) Site onboarding: issue TradePass, bind GeoTag devices, enable VaultMark
2) Capture: record depart/arrive events with signed evidence
3) Verify: PANX proof thresholds per event type
4) Govern: GCI policy gates; simulate corridor rules
5) Settle: dry‑run PvP release conditions
6) Report: sealed audit bundle + metrics

## FAQ
- Is PANX a protocol? No. PANX is a verification service that consumes protocol artifacts to produce network proofs.
- What’s sealed? Proofs, custody events, and artifacts via VaultMark.
- How do I pilot? Start with GeoTag + VaultMark at one site; add GCI/TradePass; then PANX; gate PvP last.

## Glossary
- Protocol — shared rulebook and data contracts
- Proof — evidence‑backed claim you can independently verify
- Seal — tamper‑evident record preserved for audit
- Atomic settlement — payment/delivery only complete together

## Three‑tier architecture
1) Protocols — specifications and data contracts (research repo)
2) Reference services — PANX, Cortex, ANISA (this org)
3) Platforms & apps — open‑source frontends, terminals, and integrations

#### Protocols layer
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  TP["TradePass"] --> GT["GeoTag"]
  GT --> VM["VaultMark"]
  VM --> PVP["PvP"]
  GCI["GCI"] --> TP
  GCI --> PVP
```
Protocols are composable, not strictly linear. TradePass authorizes capture, GeoTag produces signed evidence, VaultMark seals artifacts, and PvP gates settlement. GCI applies policies into both authorization and settlement.

#### Reference services layer
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  ANISA["ANISA Cultural"] <--> PANX["PANX Verification"]
  PANX -->|verified events / metrics| CORTEX["Cortex Analytics"]
  CORTEX -.->|anomaly alerts / re‑verify triggers| PANX
  CORTEX -.->|insights / topics| ANISA
```
Reference services enrich, verify, and analyze protocol artifacts. ANISA adds cultural context; PANX turns evidence + policy into network proofs; Cortex aggregates and visualizes signals for operators.

##### What actually happens (inputs → processing → outputs)
- ANISA (enrichment)
  - Inputs: site/production notes, local terms, stakeholder roles (TradePass), region hints (GeoTag)
  - Processing: cultural cues, etiquette, conflict‑avoidant phrasing, authenticity risk signals
  - Outputs: `{ authenticity_hint, tone_guidance, risk_notes[] }`
- PANX (verification)
  - Inputs: VaultMark lot metadata, GeoTag evidence, TradePass roles, GCI eligibility/policy
  - Processing: role‑weighted thresholds per event type, dissent capture, reasoned hints
  - Outputs: `{ proof_id, achieved: true|false, percentage, hints[], dissent[], contract_version }`
- Cortex (analytics)
  - Inputs: PANX proofs/events, custody/market telemetry, operator annotations
  - Processing: streaming aggregations, anomaly detection, trend/impact analyses
  - Outputs: `{ anomaly_alerts[], reverify_triggers[], dashboards, policy_insights[] }`

}
```

##### SLOs (typical targets)
- ANISA enrichment: p95 < 150ms
- PANX verification (single event): p95 < 500ms; batch proofs: p95 < 2s
- Cortex alerting/trigger propagation: p95 < 1s end‑to‑end

#### Platforms layer
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  CRX["CRX Regulatory"]
  SGX["SGX Sovereign Exchange"]
  AGX["AGX Global Exchange"]

  CRX --> SGX
  SGX --> CRX
  SGX --> AGX
  AGX --> SGX
  CRX -.-> AGX
  AGX -.-> CRX
```
Platforms interoperate rather than strictly chain. CRX feeds sovereign approval/compliance into SGX; SGX returns market and custody events back to CRX. AGX connects multiple SGX instances to international buyers; limited CRX↔AGX links exist for export controls and revenue reporting.

## Reference services (live repos)
- PANX (Oracle/Verification): `gtcx-ecosystem-cognitive/panx` — consensus, proofs, forward to Cortex
- Cortex (Analytics): `gtcx-ecosystem-cognitive/cortex` — ingest, summary, anomalies
- ANISA (Cultural Intelligence): `gtcx-ecosystem-anisa` — analyze/assess endpoints for enrichment

Each service includes: README, user/agent guides, runbooks, deploy guides, JSON Schemas, and changelogs.

## Open‑source platforms & tooling

```

### “Trade in ~6 hours” (from primer)
- Identity verified (TradePass): ~30 seconds
- Site/production evidence (GeoTag): instant
- Compliance eligibility (GCI): ~2 minutes
- Permit issuance (CRX): target same‑day, typical ≤ 6 hours
- Listing & broadcast (SGX→AGX): instant after permit
- Atomic settlement (PvP): < 1 second when trade executes
